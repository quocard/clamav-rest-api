    # depends_on is ignored in some situations (have a look at the discussion in this PR: https://github.com/benzino77/clamav-rest-api/pull/23)
    # to fix such situation there is wait-for-it script available inside the CRA docker image (https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it)
    # so to wait for clamd to be available, one could ovewrite the CMD with wait-for-it script
    # UNCOMMENT following line to check if clamav is available on host clamd and port 3310, set timeout to 60 seconds
